# Release

To release a new compositor version:

- Go to `Actions` -> [`package for release`](https://github.com/software-mansion/live-compositor/actions/workflows/package_for_release.yml) -> Trigger build on master using "Run workflow" drop-down menu.
- Wait for a job to finish.
- Run `gh run list --workflow "package for release"` and find an ID of the workflow run that packaged release binaries. Running `./scripts/release.sh` without necessary environment variables will also display that list.
- Run

  ```bash
  WORKFLOW_RUN_ID={WORKFLOW_RUN_ID} RELEASE_TAG={VERSION} ./scripts/release.sh
  ```

  e.g.

  ```bash
  WORKFLOW_RUN_ID=6302155380 RELEASE_TAG=v1.2.3 ./scripts/release.sh `
  ```
