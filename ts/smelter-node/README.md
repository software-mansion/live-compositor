# `@swmansion/smelter-node`

Provides API to create and manage Smelter instances for Node.js environment.

When you call `registerOutput` on the Smelter instance, you can pass a `ReactElement` that represents a component tree built from components included in `@swmansion/smelter` package. Those components will define what will be rendered on the output stream.

## Usage

```tsx
import Smelter from '@swmansion/smelter-node';
import { View, Text } from '@swmansion/smelter';

function ExampleApp() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>Hello world</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

async function run() {
  const smelter = new Smelter();
  await smelter.init();

  // register input/outputs/images/shaders/...

  await smelter.registerOutput('example_output', <ExampleApp />, {
    type: 'rtp_stream',
    port: 8001,
    ip: '127.0.0.1',
    transportProtocol: 'udp',
    video: {
      encoder: { type: 'ffmpeg_h264', preset: 'ultrafast' },
      resolution: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    },
    audio: {
      encoder: {
        type: 'opus',
        channels: 'stereo',
      },
    },
  });

  await smelter.start();
}
run();
```
