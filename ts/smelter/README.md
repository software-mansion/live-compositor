# `@swmansion/smelter`

This package provides a set of React components that can be used to define a composition of a video stream. Available components can only be used with React renderers specific for Smelter. Currently, we only support Node.js runtime with `@swmansion/smelter-node` package, but support for more runtimes is planned in the future.

Smelter components should not be mixed with other React or React Native components, but you can still use hooks like `useState`/`useEffect` from React.

## Getting started

To try smelter, generate a new project by running:

```
npm create smelter-app
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { View, Text, InputStream, Rescaler } from '@swmansion/smelter';

function ExampleApp() {
  return (
    <View style={{ direction: 'column' }}>
      <Rescaler style={{ rescaleMode: 'fill' }}>
        <InputStream inputId="example_input_1" />
      </Rescaler>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>Example label</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
